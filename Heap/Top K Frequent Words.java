692. Top K Frequent Words

Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return the k most frequent strings.
Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.
  
Example 1:
Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i","love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
  
Example 2:
Input: words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
Output: ["the","is","sunny","day"]
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
